# Silfra, Iceland

Diving in Silfra began in 1966. A teacher at the Stýrimannaskóli (“Seafaring School”) in Reykjavík, Þröstur Sigtryggson, had just returned to Iceland from the United States where he had learned to dive. Þröstur advertised a beginner’s diving course and a small group of interested individuals gathered to learn this new sport. After completing their course, this group went to dive in Silfra and the surrounding fissures at Thingvallavatn. Níkúlás Halldórsson, one of these first divers, says they were drawn to Silfra for the same reasons as we are today—they thought it was beautiful and clear. All of the original divers wore wet suits, as dry suits were unheard of for recreational divers at the time.

Tómas Knútsson, the founder of DIVE.IS, first dived in Silfra in 1976. Like the original Silfra divers, Tómas used a wetsuit when diving in Iceland. He switched to a dry suit in 1989, when he started to dive year round in Silfra and elsewhere in Iceland. Silfra began to gain international recognition as a dive site through Tómas’s efforts in the 1990s and 2000s.
